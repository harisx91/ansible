#Jina 2 is templating engine that allows us to substitue part 
#of the string to variables, so it is used for string manipulating

#The name is {{ my_name | replace("Haris","Harris") }} -> The name is Harris
#The name is {{ first_name | default("Ali")}}{{my_name}}->The name is Haris Ali

#List and set based filters
#{{[1,2,3]} | min }} -> 1
#{{ [1,2,3] | max }} -> 3
#{{ [1,2,3,2] | unique }} -> 1,2,3
#{{ [1,2,3,4] | union([4,5]) }} -> 1,2,3,4,5
#{{ [1,2,3,4] | intersect([4,5])}} -> 4
#{{ 100 | random }} -> Random Number
#{{ ["The","name","is","Haris"] | join (" ") }} -> The name is Haris

#Loop
#{% for number in [1,2,3,4,5] %}
